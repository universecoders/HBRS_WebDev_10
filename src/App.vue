In 1990, as part of his vision of the Web, Tim Berners-Lee defined the concept of hypertext, which Berners-Lee formalized the following year through a markup mainly based on SGML. The IETF began formally specifying HTML in 1993, and after several drafts released version 2.0 in 1995. In 1994 Berners-Lee founded the W3C to develop the Web. In 1996, the W3C took over the HTML work and published the HTML 3.2 recommendation a year later. HTML 4.0 was released in 1999 and became an ISO standard in 2000. At that time, the W3C nearly abandoned HTML in favor of XHTML, prompting the founding of an independent group called WHATWG in 2004. Thanks to WHATWG, work on HTML5 continued: the two organizations released the first draft in 2008 and the final standard in 2014."

CSS is one of the three core Web technologies, along with HTML and JavaScript. CSS usually styles HTML elements, but can be also used with other markup languages like SVG or XML. A CSS rule is a set of properties associated with a selector. Here is an example that makes every HTML paragraph yellow against a black background: Cascading refers to the rules that govern how selectors are prioritized to change a page's appearance. This is a very important feature, since a complex website can have thousands of CSS rules. The following CSS rules should be described as an example: Flexbox, Grid, Preprocessor"

Space can be assigned to the items themselves, or distributed between or around the items. Flexbox also enables alignment of items on the main or cross axis, thus providing a high level of control over the size and alignment of a group of items."

The grid that you define using these properties is described as the explicit grid. If you place content outside of this explicit grid, or if you are relying on auto-placement and the grid algorithm needs to create additional row or column tracks to hold grid items, then extra tracks will be created in the implicit grid. The implicit grid is the grid created automatically due to content being added outside of the tracks defined. In the example below I have created an explicit grid of three columns and two rows. The third row on the grid is an implicit grid row track, formed due to their being more than the six items which fill the explicit tracks."

JavaScript is a prototype-based, multi-paradigm, single-threaded, dynamic language, supporting object-oriented, imperative, and declarative (e.g. functional programming) styles. Read more about JavaScript. This section is dedicated to the JavaScript language itself, and not the parts that are specific to Web pages or other host environments. For information about APIs specific to Web pages, please see Web APIs and DOM. The standard for JavaScript is ECMAScript. As of 2012, all modern browsers fully support ECMAScript 5.1. Older browsers support at least ECMAScript 3. On June 17, 2015, ECMA International published the sixth major version of ECMAScript, which is officially called ECMAScript 2015, and was initially referred to as ECMAScript 6 or ES6. Since then, ECMAScript standards are on yearly release cycles. This documentation refers to the latest draft version, which is currently ECMAScript 2020. Do not confuse JavaScript with the Java programming language. Both Java and JavaScript are trademarks or registered trademarks of Oracle in the U.S. and other countries. However, the two programming languages have very different syntax, semantics, and uses. Please see also the following Objects article"

The global object itself can be accessed using the this operator in the global scope (but only if ECMAScript 5 strict mode is not used; in that case it returns undefined). In fact, the global scope consists of the properties of the global object, including inherited properties, if any. Other objects in the global scope are either created by the user script or provided by the host application. The host objects available in browser contexts are documented in the API reference.
